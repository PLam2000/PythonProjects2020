    "## Project 2: Beta Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "For my second project, I decided to try and make a simple function to calculate a stock's beta, which measures a stock's volatility relative to the market. If a stock has a beta of 1, its price is strongly correlated with the market. If it is higher than 1, it is more volatile than the market. If it is lower than 1, it is less volatile than the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to calculate beta, but for my function I calculated beta by dividing the covariance of the stock's returns with market returns by the variance of the market:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta = Cov(stock,market)/Var(market)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Beta is usually calculated over a 5-year period with monthly returns but my function can use different time periods for the overall period as well the length of interval or returns. The benchmark I use for the market is the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 stock market index.\n",
