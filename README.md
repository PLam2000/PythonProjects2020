# PythonProjects2020

Finding myself with a lot of spare time on my hands in the middle of quarantine, I thought it would be useful to try and learn a new skill so I decided to try and learn Python. After spending some time watching lectures, I thought the best way to learn and get experience was to create my own personal projects. The projects in my repository combine Python with my interest in finance, and to help myself learn, I  try to break down and explain my code as well as different statistical or financial concepts.
